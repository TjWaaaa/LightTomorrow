# LightTomorrow

![Concept](./files/headerLightTomorrow.png)

## Project Idea

LightTomorrow is an IoT solution, designed and developed during the 'Cloud and Internet of Things' course at the Hochschule der Medien, Stuttgart.

This project harnesses the power of AWS to control IoT devices, facilitating intelligent energy consumption in corporate environments.

The core feature of LightTomorrow is a proximity sensor that triggers the desk light to illuminate when a person approaches. Further, the system takes into consideration external light conditions, preventing unnecessary use of artificial light during daylight hours. The main intent of LightTomorrow is to assist businesses in significantly reducing their energy expenditure on lighting, promoting a greener and more sustainable future.
